# Langchain Examples

## Description
This repository contains notebooks to serve as examples for using [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html). 

## Dependencies
To run these notebooks, you will need the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Install these using pip by entering the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will also need API keys for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [SERP](https://serpapi.com/). To run the notebook without any changes, save these keys to "openai-api-key.txt" and "serp-api-key.txt" in the same directory. Alternatively, you can enter the keys into your notebook manually.
